# Pokemon Lab

## About this lab

The purpose of this lab to create a simple Pokemon battle between the user and the computer. The user is able to choose to attack, use and item or run through a menu, while the computer decides which option to use based on different factors, such as pokemon health. The program is build using Java and shows my experience in Object Oriented Porgramming.
